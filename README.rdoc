= Redmine Trackmine Plugin

Redmine is an excellent multi-project issue tracking tool focussing on
collaboration in the implementation and integration parts of software
development. Pivotal Tracker, on the other hand, is a superb planning
tool and extremely well suited for requirements capturing and customer
feedback.

The Trackmine -plugin provides simple but effective bi-directional
communication between Pivotal Tracker and Redmine by outsourcing the
workflow between Pivotal's "Started" and "Finished" states to Redmine. The triggers for teleporting
between the tools are starting a story in Pivotal and closing an issue
in Redmine. The workflow in Redmine remains customizable and can be
tailored to individual needs.


== Features

* Starting a story in a Pivotal Tracker automatically creates a Redmine issue with status "Accepted".  
* Updating a story in a Pivotal Tracker updates the Redmine issue attributes (subject, description, status).  
* Closing a Redmine issue finishes the Pivotal Tracker story.
* Mapping between Pivotal Tracker and Redmine attributes can be configured
